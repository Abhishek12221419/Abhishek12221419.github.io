            <h1>Full Stack Developer</h1>
            <p>
              I’m a final-year B.Tech student at Lovely Professional University
              with a strong interest in full-stack development. Proficient in
              the MERN stack, I enjoy tackling real-world challenges through
              technology. My journey includes building responsive and scalable
              web applications, which has given me practical development
              experience. I'm always eager to explore new tools and stay in sync
              with evolving tech trends. Crafting meaningful and innovative
              digital solutions is what drives me. My goal is to grow into a
              leading software engineer, contributing to impactful projects and
              working with collaborative, forward-thinking teams.

            <h3>Dairy Management System</h3>
            <p>
              I developed a Dairy Management System, a robust and efficient web
              application designed to streamline daily operations for dairy
              businesses. Built using Laravel, the platform offers a clean and
              responsive user interface, ensuring optimal performance across
              devices. The system handles core functionalities such as milk
              collection tracking, customer and supplier management, payment
              records, and inventory control. I implemented role-based
              authentication, CRUD operations, and data validation to ensure
              security and reliability. With Laravel’s powerful backend
              capabilities, the application ensures smooth data flow and quick
              response times, making dairy management more organized and
              hassle-free.

            <h3>• Storify - A cloud based application</h3>
            <p>
              developed Storify, a cloud-based file storage and management
              platform designed for seamless file and folder organization. It
              enables users to upload, manage, and access their files anytime
              with an intuitive interface. Key features include dynamic folder
              creation, file categorization, and real-time path navigation. The
              platform offers a smooth user experience with drag-and-drop
              support, search functionality, and a responsive design. The admin
              side includes tools for efficient storage management. Built using
              the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Storify
              ensures secure, scalable, and high-performance file handling.

            <h3>Weather Web App</h3>
            <p>
              I developed a Weather Web App using React.js, providing users with
              real-time weather updates based on their location or searched
              cities. The app integrates the OpenWeather API to fetch and
              display accurate weather data, including temperature, humidity,
              and conditions. It features a clean, responsive design and ensures
              a smooth user experience across devices.F
